# EventFunc
## Overview
The main focus of this repository is to show case ADX Capabilities. ADX is Microsoft's data exploration tool. The use in this case will reflect its near real time ingestion and fast query results.
To do so, the first step is a simulator of events. The simulator push events to event hub. ADX is configured to listen to this event hub, and ingest its content to specific table with in the ADX DB.

Simulator which push multiple events to eventhub. Each function would push diffrent type of messages to designated event hub.
The event hub would be used by ADX as the source to specific tables.

## Main Components

### PumpEvents
The function will send bulk messagesto an event hub. the event hub connection is defined within the application settings of the function app. The name of the eventhub is currently defined as part of the function code.

The function will attempt to pull from the query param *bulksize* and use this value as the number of bulk messages, in the scenario the param was not provided it will send *500* messages.

The current message sent has limited concern in the cardinality of the individual messages, as the aim and focus was to load ADX with multiple concurrent events.

### PumpSocialEvents - WIP
The function would push social events (tweets) to a designated event hub, it will send either according to a *bulksize* parameter passed. If a prameter was not passed it would use a default bulk size which is *500* messages.

### PumpIt - Logic App
The logic app, is configured as a recurring trigger. In the first scenario where the **PumpEvents** function is used the logic app, was configured to be triggered on every second. It then spawn 4-6 concurrent calls to the function ommiting 2000-3000 events per sec.
